Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It's played on an infinite, two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is either "alive" or "dead".

The game progresses through a series of generations based on these simple rules:

1. A living cell with two or three living neighbors survives to the next generation.
2. A living cell with four or more living neighbors dies due to overpopulation.
3. A living cell with one or no living neighbors dies from isolation.
4. A dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes a live cell, representing reproduction.

These rules lead to the creation of complex patterns from simple beginnings, demonstrating how intricate structures can emerge from simple rules.
