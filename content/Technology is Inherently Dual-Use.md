Technology is neither savior nor destroyer — it's a **mirror** reflecting the consciousness of those who wield it.

The same networks that *unite families* across oceans also *spread disinformation*. The algorithms that help us *find community* can trap us in *echo chambers*. The screens that give us access to all human knowledge can become walls between us and the person sitting next to us.

This duality isn't new. Quantum physics gave us both nuclear weapons and clean energy — but the bomb came first, born from a world at war.

**Technology amplifies what already exists within us**. In a society driven by fear, we build surveillance and weapons. In one driven by connection, we build bridges and communication tools.

The paradox is that technology simultaneously connects and isolates, empowers and enslaves, enlightens and deceives.

It's not the tool that determines the outcome — it's the consciousness behind it. Our challenge isn't to reject technology or blindly embrace it, but to recognize that every innovation carries this dual potential, waiting to manifest according to our collective wisdom or folly.
