A "Definite Chief Aim" is a concept popularized by Napoleon Hill in his 1937 self-help classic "Think and Grow Rich." It refers to a clearly defined purpose or goal that someone commits to achieving with unwavering focus and determination.

The concept emphasizes:

- Having a singular, specific primary goal
- Writing it down with clarity and precision
- Reading it aloud daily to program it into your subconscious
- Taking consistent action toward its achievement

Hill believed that having a Definite Chief Aim was essential for success because it provides direction, focus, and motivation. According to his philosophy, this clear purpose harnesses the power of desire and belief to overcome obstacles and manifest your goals.

This concept predates [[Objectives and Key Results (OKR)|modern goal-setting frameworks like OKRs]] but shares the emphasis on clarity and specificity, though with more focus on

- individual achievement
- and psychological commitment

rather than organizational alignment.
