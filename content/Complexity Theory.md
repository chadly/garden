Complexity theory is the study of how complex systems manifest in the world â€” from ant colonies to economies, from neural networks to ecosystems. What distinguishes these systems isn't merely their intricate interconnections or emergent properties, but their fundamental capacity for adaptation.

## Creativity as an Engine

Complex systems can change behaviors in the face of the unpredictable. It's the **creativity** that is the essence of complexity. [[Intelligence is an Act of Divergence]]

Unlike complicated systems that follow predetermined rules, complex systems generate novel responses to unprecedented challenges. This creative adaptation emerges from the dynamic interplay of [[Conway's Game of Life|countless agents following simple rules]], yet producing outcomes that transcend any individual component's capabilities.

## Rules of Complexity

### 1. Numbers Matter

There must be sufficient numbers of interacting pieces in order for complexity and self-organization to emerge.

### 2. Interactions Are Local, Not Global

Like an ant colony, each ant follows simple rules. Yet, when all those ants interact in a large colony, behaviors emerge that are more than the sum of the parts.

This mimics human cognition:

- [[The Brain Is Not an Autocrat]]
- [[Embodied Cognition Enables Quicker Responses]]

### 3. Negative Feedback Loops Prevail

In complex systems, networks of interactions feedback into themselves. This keeps a system oscillating within a healthy, *homeostatic* range.

### 4. Degree of Randomness Is Key

Complex systems can change behaviors in the face of the unpredictable. It's the **creativity** that is the essence of complexity.

The stability and creativity of the system *depends* on individual components [[Intelligence is an Act of Divergence|diverging from the rules]] that govern the rest.

These acts of unpredictability are the [[Novelty Search Over Objective Optimization|source of all the extraordinary things]] complex systems can achieve.

But, balance is key. Too much randomness prevents self-organization from occurring while too little randomness makes the system too rigid not able to respond to evolving circumstances.
