The Principle of Computational Equivalence states that **all processes following definite rules can be viewed as computations**.

This applies to:

- Human-designed algorithms
- Natural phenomena
- Physical processes
- Biological systems

## Computational Ceiling

**Almost all processes that are not obviously simple achieve the same maximum level of computational sophistication**. This means there's essentially just one "highest level" of computation, and nearly everything complex reaches it.

This upper limit of computational sophistication in our universe acts as a *law of nature* limiting what computations are possible.

## The Paradox

While we can know systems are computationally equivalent, we often can't predict their behavior without running them step by step. This explains _why_ [[Computational Irreducibility|computational irreducibility]] exists: when observer and system have equivalent computational power, there's no shortcut to prediction. The observer must essentially "keep pace" with the system's evolution.
