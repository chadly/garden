OKR stands for "Objectives and Key Results." It's a goal-setting framework used by organizations to define and track objectives and their outcomes.

The framework has two main components:

- [[Objectives Are a False Compass|Objectives]]: These are qualitative, ambitious goals that define what you want to accomplish
- Key Results: These are specific, measurable outcomes that determine whether the objective has been met

OKRs are typically set quarterly and are designed to align teams around common goals while providing clear metrics for success. The framework was popularized by companies like Intel and Google, and is now widely used across many industries to help organizations focus on measurable outcomes and drive growth.
