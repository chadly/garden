Rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD) is an intense emotional response to perceived or actual rejection, criticism, or failure. People with RSD experience extreme emotional pain and negative reactions when they feel they've been rejected or criticized, even when the rejection is minor or imagined.

RSD is commonly associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), though it's not an official diagnostic criterion for ADHD. People with RSD may:

- Experience intense emotional pain that feels unbearable
- Have emotional responses that are disproportionate to the situation
- Anticipate rejection and react preemptively
- Develop people-pleasing behaviors or perfectionism
- Avoid situations where they might be rejected or criticized
- Feel extreme anxiety or shame in social situations

While RSD isn't formally recognized as a distinct medical condition in diagnostic manuals like the DSM-5, it's increasingly acknowledged by mental health professionals as a real experience that significantly impacts many people's lives, particularly those with ADHD or autism spectrum conditions.
